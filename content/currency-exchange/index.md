Osmani International Airport in Sylhet, Bangladesh, offers several options for currency exchange and ATM facilities to accommodate the needs of international travelers. The airport is well-equipped to handle the needs of passengers, including providing a range of financial services such as ATMs and currency exchange facilities.

## ATMs
ATMs are widely available at the airport, with several banks operating ATM machines in the arrival and departure halls. Passengers can easily withdraw cash in Bangladeshi Taka or other currencies using their credit or debit cards. These ATMs are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and offer a convenient and efficient way for travelers to access cash during their trip.

## Currency exchange 
In addition to ATMs, the airport also has currency exchange facilities that allow travelers to exchange their foreign currency for Bangladeshi Taka. The currency exchange counter is located in the arrival and departure halls, and are staffed by experienced personnel who can provide advice and assistance to travelers regarding currency exchange.

The currency exchange counters offer competitive rates for a range of foreign currencies, including US dollars, euros, British pounds, and Japanese yen. The rates are updated regularly to ensure that travelers receive a fair exchange rate. However, it is important to note that currency exchange rates can vary significantly between different providers, so it is always a good idea to compare rates and fees before making a transaction.

One important consideration for travelers using ATM and currency exchange facilities at the airport is the fees and charges that may be associated with these services. Banks and exchange providers may charge fees for their services, including foreign exchange fees and ATM transaction fees. These fees can vary depending on the bank or provider, and it is important for travelers to be aware of these fees before using the services.

To avoid unexpected fees and charges, travelers should consider checking with their bank or credit card provider before traveling to ensure that their card is authorized for use in Bangladesh, and to inquire about any fees or charges that may be applied for using their card abroad. It may also be a good idea to carry a mix of cash and cards, and to keep an eye on exchange rates to ensure that the best deal is obtained.
