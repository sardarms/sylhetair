Like most countries, Bangladesh has a list of dutiable and prohibited items that are restricted from being brought into the country. It is important for passengers to be aware of these regulations to avoid any inconvenience or legal issues upon arrival. Here are some examples of dutiable and prohibited items at Osmani International Airport:

Currency: Passengers are required to declare any currency or monetary instruments they are carrying that exceed the amount of $10,000 USD or equivalent in other currencies.

Alcohol and Tobacco: Importing alcohol and tobacco products is only allowed for those over 18 years of age and in limited quantities. The allowance for alcohol is two bottles of wine or spirits, and the allowance for tobacco is 200 cigarettes, 50 cigars, or 225 grams of tobacco.

Firearms and Explosives: The import of firearms, ammunition, and explosives is strictly prohibited, except for those who are authorized by the government.

Narcotics: The import of any illegal drugs or narcotics is strictly prohibited, and those found with such substances will face legal action.

Cultural Property: The export of any cultural property, including antiques and artifacts, is prohibited without proper documentation and clearance from the government.

Endangered Species: The import of any endangered species of plants or animals, their by-products, or hunting trophies is strictly prohibited under international conservation laws.

Pornography: The import or export of any pornographic material is strictly prohibited under Bangladeshi law.

Electronics: import duty may be charged on the import of certain electronics based on the number of items. 

It is essential for passengers to familiarize themselves with the customs regulations of Bangladesh and any other countries they may be traveling to or from. Those found carrying prohibited or undeclared items may face fines, imprisonment, or other legal penalties. It is always better to err on the side of caution and check with the customs authorities or airline representatives if unsure about any item.
