## Wifi

The airport provides free Wi-Fi internet access to passengers throughout the terminal buildings. Passengers can easily connect to the airport's Wi-Fi network by selecting a number of free wifi network from their device's available Wi-Fi networks and following the on-screen instructions. However, almost all free wifi will require a local cell number, which can be problematic for people who just landed and do not have any local number. 

## Sim card

There is no option to buy any simcard at the airport.
